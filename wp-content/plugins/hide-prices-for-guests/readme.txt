Hide product prices and disable purchasing for non-logged-in users in WooCommerce.

== Description ==

Hide Prices for Guests is a simple plugin that hides product prices and disables the ability to purchase products for users who are not logged in to your WordPress site. This is perfect for wholesale stores, membership sites, or any WooCommerce store that wants to encourage user registration.

= Features =

* Hide product prices for non-logged-in users
* Replace prices with a customizable message
* Disable the "Add to Cart" button for non-logged-in users
* Easy to configure through the WordPress admin

= How It Works =

When a non-logged-in user visits your WooCommerce store, instead of seeing product prices, they will see a message like "Login to View Pricing" (which you can customize). Additionally, they won't be able to add products to their cart, encouraging them to register or log in to make purchases.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `hide-prices-for-guests` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Go to Settings > Hide Prices for Guests to configure the plugin
